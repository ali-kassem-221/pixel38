laravel-react CRUD

first you must import the database named pixel 38 to mysql(php my admin).
then open xampp -> start mysql, and the server-> and llaunch the laravel project from cmd(php artisan serve + npm run watch).
iam sorry i didnt work with graphql and i didnt completed all the CRUD  beacuase i thought iam too late so i decided to send it to you whatever i worked on it, but trust me i have the ability to learn fast and to commit to all projects, hope you take into consideration its my first laravel react project. and thank you, hope you reply to me
